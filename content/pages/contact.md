If you would like to contact me for any reason, please email me at [s@stefans.dev](mailto:s@stefans.dev).
You can also use my social networks to do so:

I'm not always available for client work, but I'm always open to discuss it with you, I can recommend someone fit for it.
If its headless / jamstack project, I encourage you to do so, I'm realy interested in those.
